                <h3>What is the best time of year to visit Disney World?</h3>
                <p class = "short">Mid-January to early March and late August to early October are usually best</p>
                <p class = "long hidden">These months typically have lighter crowds, lower wait times, and more manageable weather. 
                    Holidays and school breaks tend to be the busiest times, while off-season dates often come with special promotions and lower hotel rates.</p>

            <div class = "faq">
                <h3>Can I bring my own food and drinks into the park?</h3>
                <p class = "short">Yes, small snacks and non-alcoholic drinks are allowed.</p>
                <p class = "long hidden">Guests may bring their own snacks and drinks into the park, provided they are not in glass containers and do not require reheating. 
                    Large coolers and alcohol are not permitted. Disney also offers free cups of ice water at quick-service restaurants.</p>

            <div class = "faq">
                <h3>Do I need to make park reservations in addition to buying tickets?</h3>
                <p class = "short">You need both a ticket and a park reservation.</p>
                <p class = "long hidden">A valid ticket grants you entry, but you must also secure a park reservation for the specific park you want to visit that day. 
                    Reservations can fill up quickly during peak times, so it's best to book them as soon as your plans are set.</p>

            <div class = "faq">
                <h3>What is Genie+ and Lightning Lane?</h3>
                <p class = "short">Genie+ lets you skip standby lines by booking Lightning Lane times.</p>
                <p class = "long hidden">Genie+ is a paid add-on service that allows you to select return times for certain attractions, skipping the regular standby queue. 
                    Some of the most popular rides require an <em>Individual Lightning Lane purchase</em> (separate from Genie+). 
                    This can save hours of waiting, especially on busy days.</p>

            <div class = "faq">
                <h3>Do Disney characters really sign autographs?</h3>
                <p class = "short">Yes, most characters will sign autographs!</p>
                <p class = "long hidden">Disney characters such as Mickey, Minnie, and the princesses often carry special autograph books to sign for guests. 
                    It's a fun keepsake, especially for kids, and you can buy autograph books in the parks or bring your own. Some characters (like Buzz Lightyear or Olaf) may not sign but will stamp or give a unique mark instead.</p>
